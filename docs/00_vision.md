# SRCI – System Reliability & Change Intelligence

SRCI is a read-only engineering intelligence platform that helps SREs and platform engineers
predict the impact of system changes before deployment and explain production failures after they occur
using dependency graphs and evidence-based reasoning.

## Primary User
Site Reliability Engineers and platform engineers responsible for system stability.

## Core Problems
- Lack of visibility into downstream impact of changes
- Slow and manual incident root-cause analysis

## Non-Goals
- Automated remediation
- Replacing monitoring or CI/CD tools
- Writing or deploying code
